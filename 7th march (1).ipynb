    "    The sign of the covariance (+/-) indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative),\n",

    "    However, covariance alone does not provide a standardized measure and its value is influenced by the scales of the variables. \n",
    "    Covariance can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "          \" | * cov(X, Y) = Σ((Xᵢ - X̄)(Yᵢ - Ȳ)) / (n - 1) \"\n",

    "    variables. A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, 1 indicates a perfect positive \n",
    "    relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. Correlation is calculated by dividing the covariance by the product\n",
    "    of the standard deviations of the variables.\n",
    "    The formula for correlation (specifically Pearson correlation coefficient)  is as follows:\n",
    "            \" * ρ(X, Y) = cov(X, Y) / (σ(X) * σ(Y)) \"\n",
