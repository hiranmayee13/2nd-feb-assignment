    "1.Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "    Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing the main characteristics of a dataset. \n",
    "    It provides a way to organize, present, and analyze data in a meaningful manner.\n",
    "    Here are some common descriptive statistics measures and their applications:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        @_Measures of Central Tendency: \n",
    "            These include the mean, median, and mode. They describe the typical or average valuein a dataset.\n",
    "            For example, the mean income of a group of people can be calculated to understand the average \n",
    "            earning level.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        @_Measures of Dispersion: \n",
    "            These measures, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation, describe the spread or \n",
    "            variability of the\n",
    "            data.\n",
    "            They help quantify how much the values differ from the central tendency.\n",
    "            For instance, the standard deviation of test scores can indicate how much variation there is\n",
    "            among students \n",
    "            performance.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        @_Percentiles:\n",
    "            Percentiles divide a dataset into equal-sized groups, indicating the position of a particular\n",
    "            value relative \n",
    "            to the rest\n",
    "            of the data. They help understand the distribution of values and identify outliers.\n",
    "            For instance, the 90th percentile of household income can indicate the income level at which\n",
    "            90% of the population \n",
    "            falls below.\n",
    "            \n",
    "2.Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "    Inferential statistics involves making inferences and drawing conclusions about a population based on a \n",

    "    It uses probability theory and sampling techniques to generalize findings from the sample to the larger \n",
    "    population.\n",

    "            particular\n",
    "            claim about a population based on sample data.\n",
    "            For example, a company might conduct hypothesis testing to assess whether a new marketing strategy \n",
    "            has a significant\n",
    "            impact on sales.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        @_Confidence Intervals:\n",
    "            Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which a population parameter is likely to fall.\n",
    "            They help estimate the uncertainty associated with sample statistics.\n",
    "            For instance, a pollster might use a confidence interval to estimate the proportion of voters \n",

    "        each type of data.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    In data science, there are four main types of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "    These types differ based on the nature of the data and the level of measurement they represent. \n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Nominal Data:\n",
    "    Nominal data consists of categories or labels that have no numerical significance.\n",
    "    The categories are distinct and mutually exclusive, but they do not have any inherent order or magnitude.\n",
    "    Nominal data is qualitative in nature and primarily used for classification or grouping purposes.\n",
    "    Examples of nominal data include:\n",
    "        @_Colors of cars (e.g., red, blue, green)\n",
    "        @_Types of animals (e.g., cat, dog, bird)\n",
    "        @_Marital status (e.g., married, single, divorced)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Ordinal Data:\n",
    "    Ordinal data represents categories that have a natural order or ranking but does not have a consistent or quantifiable \n",
    "    interval between them.\n",
    "    The differences between the categories are not precisely measured.\n",
    "    Ordinal data allows for a relative comparison between categories, but it does not provide precise information about the \n",
    "    magnitude of differences.\n",
    "    Examples of ordinal data include:\n",
    "        @_Ratings of a restaurant (e.g., excellent, good, fair)\n",
    "        @_Educational levels (e.g., elementary, high school, college)\n",
    "        @_Survey responses with a Likert scale (e.g., strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree)\n",
    "3.Interval Data:\n",
    "    Interval data represents numerical data where the intervals between values are equal and meaningful.\n",
    "    It does not have a true zero point, meaning that zero does not indicate the absence of the variable but rather a point \n",

    "    In interval data, mathematical operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed,\n",
