    "\"\"\"What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    Flask allows you to create web applications by defining routes or URLs that correspond to different\n",
    "    pages or functionalities of your application. When a user visits a specific URL, Flask maps that URL\n",
    "    to a particular function in your code, known as a view function. This function then generates the \n",
    "    content that will be displayed on the users browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Advantages:\n",
    " * Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python.\n",
    " * It helps you build web applications quickly and easily.\n",
    " * With Flask, you define routes that correspond to different pages or functionalities.\n",
    " * It handles HTTP requests and generates responses for users.\n",
    " * Flask simplifies web development, allowing you to focus on your applications logic."
